## Social Media Application

This is a social media application containing 4 main entities : Users, posts, likes and comments.
 We have various entities with a bunch of attributes, and we need to clearly know the relationship between each of these entities. In this application, a
user can create a post of 2 types, text-post or media-post, and other users (including the creator of the post) can like the post, and write a comment on the post. Users can also like comments,
allowing a lot of features for a fully functioning social media application.
